# scanjs
ScanJS implements the Strucural Clustering Algorithm designed by Xiaowei Xu, Nurcan Yuruk, Zhidan Feng and Thomas A. J. Schweiger [PDF] (https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~cis4930fa07dm/project/Scan.pdf)

It provides two JS classes.

* Graph.js : To create a graph
* Scan.js : To build the clustering

See test for examples (where the example Graph of the Paper is provided)
